# react-native-linear-algebra
React native app to compare the performance of tensorflow and numeric.js for some linear algebra operations 


## Instalation
Clone the repo and run 
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Quick Start
To start the serve
```bash
$ npm run android
```
It was used on android and I am not sure if tensorflow will work with this configuration on ios.
